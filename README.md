# DependencySync
Dependency Sync is a tool to make synchronizing dependencies between multiple projects fast and easy.

## Please Note: 
First things first, all this program does is move a file from path A to path B. (This was more of a proof of concept app to allow for it to be implemented into a batch file)
Dependency Sync is incomplete and has many known bugs and glitches.
Additionally the code is most likely unoptimized at this time.
Thank you for your patience while development progresses.
